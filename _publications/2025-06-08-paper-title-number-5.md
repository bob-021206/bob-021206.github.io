Traditional interactive narrative systems offer strong authorial control and structural coherence but often restrict player agency.  
In contrast, LLM-driven narratives enable open-ended generation and greater flexibility, yet frequently suffer from inconsistency and diminished narrative control.  

To reconcile this trade-off, we propose a **hybrid narrative framework** that dynamically balances pre-authored content with real-time LLM generation via **semantic similarity alignment**.  

Additionally, sustaining narrative quality over extended gameplay remains a core challenge in LLM-based storytelling.  
To address this, we introduce a **self-evolving, feedback-driven optimization framework** that leverages **in-context learning** to iteratively refine prompts, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering.  

Through a case study and participant-based evaluation, we show that our framework enhances narrative coherence while preserving player agency, effectively aligning generated content with both authorial intent and evolving player behavior.

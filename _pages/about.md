Master's student in Computer Science at Columbia University

Email: bs3654@columbia.edu

**Biography:**
I am a first year master's student in the [MSCS](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/) program at [Columbia Engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/), [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I received a dual B.S. degree in Computer Science from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) and [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/).

**Research interests:**
AI Agents, Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Human–Computer Interaction (HCI).

I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bing Luo, Ph.D.](https://luobing1008.github.io/), at Duke Kunshan University, under whose supervision I developed a self-evolving narrative system based on LLMs. This work has been submitted to [ACM CHI 2026](https://chi2026.acm.org/) for review.
